EDUGUM

AIM
Edugum is an online platform that will connect teachers and student together from entire country together to study online from the best professors they want.
To achieve this, we will setup a smart class inside the class rooms of the educational institutions. The classes will be recorded and saved to the server automatically.

BENIFITS
Now if any student is absent in the class and want to see the recorded lecture or any other student from other remote place want to learn some specific topic from that very professor then he can login to our website and pay a very nominal amount (Most Probably Rs. 10 per lecture) and continue his learning. The teacher will also get a small amount out of the money collected from student. The number of students will increase, profit will increase.

REQUIREMENT
In order to achieve this we have to setup smart class facility inside the classroom of which the teacher is interested to join with us. Once done, we will connect that classroom camera with our server which will automatically send the recorded video to the server.  We need a high quality video delivering server with Learning Management System integrated with it. We also need to set payment gateway for student to collect payment and to send payouts to the teachers.

PROGRESS
We have currently created a Learning Management System using MOODLE to setup accounts of teachers to create live video lectures for the students using BIGBLUEBUTTON plugin which both are open source platforms. We want to customize these modules and create a smart solution along with mobile application to achieve our goal. For this we need financial investments. 

DEADLINE
We would like to finish this project and launch in the market by the end of year 2021.
